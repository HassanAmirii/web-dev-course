# Reading the Docs

## Instructions

There are many tools that a web developer may need that are on the [MDN documentation for client-side tooling](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Tools_and_testing/Understanding_client-side_tools/Overview). Select 3 tools not covered in the lesson, explain why a web developer would use it, and search for a tool that falls under this category and share its documentation. Do not use the same tool example on MDN docs.

###  Tool category: Safety net
- **1. [Linter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software))** are tools that help you check through your codes for errors and tell you about it, They also help you check if you are following the right standard of a particular programming language while you are coding, more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lint_(software)).</u>

- An example of a linter is [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/):  Checkstyle is a development tool to help programmers write Java code that adheres to a coding standard. It automates the process of checking Java code to spare humans of this boring (but important) task. This makes it ideal for projects that want to enforce a coding standard.

   - Why a Web Developer Would Use  [checkstyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/): Checkstyle can check many aspects of your source code. It can find class design problems, method design problems. It also has the ability to check code layout and formatting issues.

- Documentation: visit [checkstyle main documentation page](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/index.html).

- **2.  [Source code management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_Code_Control_System).** AKA version control software are tools that help you maintain changes made in your code base, it allows you to switch to any versions you've previously saved.

- An example of source code control software is [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial): It's a version control system designed to track changes in source code and other text files during the development of a piece of software. This allows the user to retrieve any of the previous versions of the original source code and the changes which are stored. 
  
  - Why a Web Developer Would Use [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial):
  
    - [Mercurial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercurial)'s major design goals include high performance and scalability, decentralization, fully distributed collaborative development, robust handling of both plain text and binary files, and advanced branching and merging capabilities, while remaining conceptually simple.[5] It includes an integrated web-interface. Mercurial has also taken steps to ease the transition for users of other version control systems, particularly Subversion. Mercurial is primarily a command-line driven program, but graphical user interface extensions are available, e.g. TortoiseHg, and several IDEs

- **3. [Type checker](tab:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system).** These are software programs that analyze code and identify potential errors or problems related to data types.

- An example of a type checker software is [pyright](https://microsoft.github.io/pyright/#/): it is a full-featured, high-performance static type checker for Python, developed by Microsoft. It's designed to help catch type-related errors early in the development process, improve code quality, and boost productivity. Pyright is available as both a command-line tool and a language server, and it is also integrated into Visual Studio Code through the Pylance extension.
